## Voltz Community Modpack
- Modpack: [Voltz Community Modpack](https://voltzmodpack.com)
- Minecraft version: 1.7.10
- IP: vcm.digitalhazards.net
- Notable plugins: McMMO, CombatTag, PvPLevels, PlayerHeads, DiscordSRV, ChestShop

##### Here at DH Voltz Community we provide the highest quality Voltz experience, with features such as:
- All dupe glitches fixed
- Player Shops at spawn
- Very few banned items (just spatial pylons and formulaic assemblicators for now, working on fixes)
- Players drop their heads on death
- Ender quarries and digital miners honor forcefield protection
- EMPs and trackers work like in the original Voltz modpack
- Power Armor protects against radiation
- Ender quarries have a maximum width of 80 (no more quarrying the entire map)
- Meteors only fall within 2000 blocks of spawn in each planet other than the overworld (people can't find your moon base by the amount of meteors above it)
