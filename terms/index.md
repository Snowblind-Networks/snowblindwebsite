## Will donators get their money back if they get banned?
Getting banned as a donor is something that is your responsibility, if you are seen or heard breaking any form of network rules and Admin, Moderator, Manager, Owner, or any other network staff member can and will exercise their right to punish you, therefore being permanently banned for your own actions as a donator you will NOT receive any form of refund as this was your own choice to disobey the rules set by the specified Server. Appealing on the Forum is allowed and will be handled by a Server staff member or a Network Staff member, please note any ruling done by a Network staff member is final and cannot be overruled,
Attempting to charge back after being banned from a server will not be met with a friendly face, our Network is known for its fair and reasonable staff members but we also has a 98.5% Chargeback win rate when dealing with Scammer or Server Donors who feel they need to try their luck.
