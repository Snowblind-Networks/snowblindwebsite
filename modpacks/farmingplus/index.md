Welcome to Snowblind Farming Plus, a Farmville and Farming Simulator inspired modpack based around agriculture!
<br />
Have fun living the simple country life, farming grain and tending animals. This modpack features some of the best farm-based mods such as Agricraft, Growthcraft, Forestry (with add-ons), Animania, and so much more.
<br />
<br />
As a relatively lightweight 1.12.2 pack (~50 non-tech and non-magic mods) this should run well on any modern computer.
<br />
<br />
On the official server you can use our custom islands plugin to create your own farm island in which to farm in peace. Progress through in-game ranks with the money you earn from selling your crops to be able to unlock, grow, and sell new crops for more money.
Your own dimension starts as a 3x3 Chunks, can get up to 16x16 Chunks.
